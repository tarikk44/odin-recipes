# odin-recipes

This my (second) first time doing this project from the TOP foundations course.
Main goal of this project is building a basic recipes website with only HTML.

It will consist of:
-main index page with links to other recipe pages
-and individual recipe page with all neccessary things for a recipe

*Demonstrating my skills
-structuring HTML pages
-using relative links
-working with text elements, images, lists
-practicing my git skills

------------

This project serves as introduction to web development and will be updated as I learn, progress and apply my acquired knowledge
