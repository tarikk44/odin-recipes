                <h3>Delicious Tres Leches cake</h3>
            </div>
            <p class="p1">A tres leches cake is a sponge cake that is soaked in three kinds of milk. Though the cake is saturated
                in liquid, it's
                not dense — tres leches is known for its light and fluffy texture.

            <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>

            <li>Sift flour and baking powder together; set aside.</li>
            <li>Beat sugar and butter together in a large bowl with an electric mixer until lighter in color and fluffy.
                Add eggs and
                vanilla; beat well. Add flour mixture, about 1/2 cup at a time, mixing until well blended.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 30 minutes.

                over with a fork; let cool to room temperature.</li>
            <li>Mix whole milk, condensed milk, and evaporated milk together in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Pour the whole milk, condensed milk, and evaporated milk mixture over the top of the cooled cake and
                allow to soak in.</li>
            <li>Whip cream, remaining 1 cup of sugar, and 1 teaspoon vanilla in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an
                electric mixer
                until thick.</li>
            <li>When milk mixture has soaked in, spread cream on top of the cake.</li>
            <li>Keep cake refrigerated until ready to serve. Sprinkle ground cinnamon over top of the cake before
                slicing. Enjoy!</li>
